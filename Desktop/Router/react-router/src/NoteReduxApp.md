Redux will remove state mangement from context API and move it to a package that we can install and is built on top of redux.
Redux is popular open-source javaScript library .this helpful to build user interfaces with librarier like React  .
Now er're gonna do clean up for librarier in package JSON that we don't use it in terminal window from dependency.
Computed values frm easy-peasy and to know how many posts we have , then will have a post by id which will return anonymous function ,
then will have thunk which represents asynchronous function 
then will use api and post in the newPost that passed in ,
then adding store to our application in index.js so the storeProvider will provide state that we have in the store ,
then will remove data provider of App.js 
then will import in the App store provider and will put our data back in the App.js we need to pull in setPosts from storeActions
Now will import easy-peasy in Nav then in all components
